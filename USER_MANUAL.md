### **Introduction**
What is Golden Generation ?
Golden Generation is a web-based time banking platform designed to strengthen community bonds and support retirees through mutual assistance and social engagement. The platform enables community members to exchange services, participate in events, and build meaningful connections.
The Problem We Solve
Many retirees face challenges with: 
- Social Isolation: Limited opportunities to connect with others
- Service Access: Difficulty finding help for daily tasks 
- Community Engagement: Lack of structured activities and events 
- Skill Sharing: No platform to share valuable life experiences
